# ---- HEATING COOLING PARAMETERS ---- #

variable HEATING equal true # flag that must be overwritten when necessary in the script and tell if there is  heating or cooling. false=cooling ; true=heating
variable DTcurrent equal 0 # Cumulative global temperature variation from the initial temperature T0 through the multiple runs [K]
variable DTtarget equal 100.0 # Temperatuve variation [K] (absolute value, always positive. Ideally a multiple of DTstep)
variable DTstep equal 1.0 # Temperature increments [K / heating step]
variable Nrun_hc equal 50000 # Number of timestep during which the geometry is changed due to heating/cooling
variable Nevery_hc equal 10 # Frequency of geometry change during heating
variable Ncycle equal 1 # Number of heating - cooling cycles
