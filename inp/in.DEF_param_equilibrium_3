# THIS IS A DEF SCRIPT, ALL VARIABLES AND COMPUTES IN THIS SUBSCRIPT ARE GLOBAL AND GIVEN DEFAULT VALUES THAT CAN BE OVERWRITTEN LOCALLY IN THE MAIN SCRIPT
# THIS SCRIPT MUST ONLY BE CALLED ONE TIME
#
#
# INFO :
# - variable `var_param_equilibrium_3` (index-style) is passed to LAMMPS by command line switch -var var_param_equilibrium_3

# ---- PARAMETERS ---- #

variable tolke0 equal ${var_param_equilibrium_3} # Relative tolerance on the average kinetic energy [Radaji Dubois 2011]
variable tolke equal ${tolke0} # Default value
next var_param_equilibrium_3
variable tolfres0 equal ${var_param_equilibrium_3} # Relative tolerance on the force residual [Radaji Dubois 2011] recommended 1e-4 by Agnolin but too strong in polydisperse
variable tolfres equal ${tolfres0} # Default value
next var_param_equilibrium_3
variable toltqres0 equal ${var_param_equilibrium_3} # Relative tolerance on the torque residual
variable toltqres equal ${toltqres0} # Default value
next var_param_equilibrium_3
variable tolufr0 equal ${var_param_equilibrium_3} # Tolerance on the unbalanced force ratio [Wautier,Zhao2016] use 1e-5
variable tolufr equal ${tolufr0} # Default value
next var_param_equilibrium_3
variable tolp0 	equal ${var_param_equilibrium_3} # Relative tolerance on the pressure [Suiker 2004]
variable tolp 	equal ${tolp0} # Default value
# NEVER call `next` on the variable at the end of the definitions.
# This would exhaust the variable and skip the next `jump` command and cause other scripts to fail !
