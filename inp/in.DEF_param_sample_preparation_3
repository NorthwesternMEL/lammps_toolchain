# THIS IS A DEF SCRIPT, ALL VARIABLES AND COMPUTES IN THIS SUBSCRIPT ARE GLOBAL AND GIVEN DEFAULT VALUES THAT CAN BE OVERWRITTEN LOCALLY IN THE MAIN SCRIPT
# THIS SCRIPT MUST ONLY BE CALLED ONE TIME
#
#
# INFO :
# - MUST BE DEFINED AFTER DEF_param_material_3 IN MAIN SCRIPT
# - MUST BE DEFINED BEFORE SET SCRIPTS IN MAIN SCRIPT
# - variable `var_param_sample_preparation_3` (index-style) is passed to LAMMPS by command line switch -var var_param_sample_preparation_3
# - variable `file_PSD` (index-style) is passed to LAMMPS by command line switch -var file_PSD

# ---- SAMPLE PREPARATION PARAMETERS ---- #

# Sample size
variable Nparticles equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Number of particles in the system
next var_param_sample_preparation_3
variable aspectratio equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Aspect ratio of the simulation box: aspectratio = Z_dimension/X.Y_dimension
next var_param_sample_preparation_3
variable wallpad equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Additional padding of walls from periodic cell boundary
next var_param_sample_preparation_3

# Random generation
variable READPSD equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Defines is PSD read from file (true) or created uniformly by LAMMPS (false)
next var_param_sample_preparation_3
variable latseed equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Random integer seed for filling of lattice sites randomly
next var_param_sample_preparation_3
variable dseed equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Random integer seed for uniform particle diameter
next var_param_sample_preparation_3
variable orientseed equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Random integer seed for orientation of clumps upon lattice deposition
next var_param_sample_preparation_3

# Mixing
variable pfmin equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Minimum packing fraction of lattice deposition before mixing: 0.49 in 3D, [Agnolin 2007] uses 0.45 in 3D to make room for mixing
next var_param_sample_preparation_3
variable mixamount equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Mixing stops when average particle displacement is mixamount times the average diameter, depends on PBC or WALL, less movement with walls, sould be lower
next var_param_sample_preparation_3
variable mixintensity equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Intensity of the mixing,magnitude of the mean velocity given in fraction of diameter dsys traveled over the characteristic time tsys (must be very small)
next var_param_sample_preparation_3
variable mixseed equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Random integer seed for velocity of particles mixing
next var_param_sample_preparation_3
variable contact_expansion equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # fraction of the scaling to separate contacts after mixing (uniform scaling of magnitude 1+contact_expansion)
next var_param_sample_preparation_3

# Percolation
variable pf0 equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Target packing fraction for sample generation, cannot be too large
next var_param_sample_preparation_3
variable In0_percolation equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Inertial number for first shrinkage from low packing fraction granular gas to target packing fraction granular gas
next var_param_sample_preparation_3
variable relax_overlap equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Average normalized overlap (Kappa^-1 = h/d) to stop relaxation. We use 5 times this overlap to separate the contacts after relaxation
next var_param_sample_preparation_3

# Equilibrium
variable Ppreparation equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Isotropic pressure at which sample is prepared [Pa]
next var_param_sample_preparation_3
variable In0_pressure equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Inertial number for second shrinkage to target isotropic pressure
next var_param_sample_preparation_3
variable In0_equilibrium equal ${var_param_sample_preparation_3} # Inertial number for final equilibrium to all convergence criteria at target isotropic pressure

# File to get PSD from. Read separately by LAMMPS command line switch for parsing purposes
variable PSDfile string ${file_PSD} # Particle Size distribution file read for the simulation, put this here and not in `in.DEF_init_material` because it is only needed for sample preparation
variable fname_read_PSD string "${PSDfile}" # Once sample is created, restart files contain the diameter info and a PSD file is not need
# NEVER call `next` on the variable at the end of the definitions.
# This would exhaust the variable and skip the next `jump` command and cause other scripts to fail !
