# LAMMPS INPUT FILE DEFINING THE VALUES FOR NO EQUILIBRATION FOR 3D GRANULAR SYSTEMS

# author: JBC @ NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY, (jibril.coulibaly@gmail.com)
#
# THIS IS A PRESET SCRIPT, ALL VARIABLES AND COMPUTES IN THIS SUBSCRIPT ARE GLOBAL AND ARE LOCALLY REDEFINED ACCORDING TO PRESET VALUES
# THIS SCRIPT CAN BE CALLED MULTIPLE TIMES
# PRESET SCRIPT MUST BE CALLED BEFORE THE CORRESPONDING START SCRIPT
#
#
# INFO:
# - SETS VERY SMALL TOLERANCE FOR ALL VARIABLES SO THAT EQUILIBRIUM IS NEVER REACHED. HANDY FOR ALTERNATED RUNS THAT ARE / ARE NOT EQUILIBRATED. AVOIDS STOPPING EQUILIBRATION AND RESTARTING IT

variable tolke equal 1e-20 # Very large value, always verified
variable tolfres equal 1e-20 # Very large value, always verified
variable toltqres equal 1e-20 # Very large value, always verified
variable tolufr equal 1e-20 # Very large value, always verified
variable tolp 	equal 1e-20 # Very large value, always verified
