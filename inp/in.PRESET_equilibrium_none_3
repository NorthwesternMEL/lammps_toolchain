# THIS IS A PRESET SCRIPT, ALL VARIABLES AND COMPUTES IN THIS SUBSCRIPT ARE GLOBAL AND ARE LOCALLY REDEFINED ACCORDING TO PRESET VALUES
# THIS SCRIPT CAN BE CALLED MULTIPLE TIMES
# PRESET SCRIPT MUST BE CALLED BEFORE THE CORRESPONDING START SCRIPT
#
#
# INFO:
# - SETS VERY SMALL TOLERANCE FOR ALL VARIABLES SO THAT EQUILIBRIUM IS NEVER REACHED. HANDY FOR ALTERNATED RUNS THAT ARE / ARE NOT EQUILIBRATED. AVOIDS STOPPING EQUILIBRATION AND RESTARTING IT
