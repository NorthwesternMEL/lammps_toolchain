# THIS IS A PRESET SCRIPT, ALL VARIABLES AND COMPUTES IN THIS SUBSCRIPT ARE GLOBAL AND ARE LOCALLY REDEFINED ACCORDING TO PRESET VALUES
# THIS SCRIPT CAN BE CALLED MULTIPLE TIMES
# PRESET SCRIPT MUST BE CALLED BEFORE THE CORRESPONDING START SCRIPT
#
#
# INFO:
# - SETS LARGE TOLERANCE FOR NON-STRESS VARIABLES THAT ARE NOT EQUILIBRATED
