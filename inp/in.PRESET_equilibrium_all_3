# THIS IS A PRESET SCRIPT, ALL VARIABLES AND COMPUTES IN THIS SUBSCRIPT ARE GLOBAL AND ARE LOCALLY REDEFINED ACCORDING TO PRESET VALUES
# THIS SCRIPT CAN BE CALLED MULTIPLE TIMES
# PRESET SCRIPT MUST BE CALLED BEFORE THE CORRESPONDING START SCRIPT

# INFO:
# - SETS DEFAULT TOLERANCE FOR ALL VARIABLES

variable tolke equal 1e-8 # Relative tolerance on the average kinetic energy [Radaji Dubois 2011]
variable tolfres equal 1e-4 # Relative tolerance on the force residual [Radaji Dubois 2011] recommended 1e-4 by Agnolin but too strong in polydisperse
variable toltqres equal 1e-4 # Relative tolerance on the torque residual
variable tolufr equal 1e-5 # Tolerance on the unbalanced force ratio [Wautier,Zhao2016] use 1e-5
variable tolp 	equal 1e-4 # Relative tolerance on the pressure [Suiker 2004]
