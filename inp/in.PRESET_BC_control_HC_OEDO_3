# THIS SCRIPT CAN BE CALLED MULTIPLE TIMES
# PRESET SCRIPT MUST BE CALLED BEFORE THE CORRESPONDING START SCRIPT
#
#
# INFO:
# - MUST BE CALLED AFTER DEF_param_BC_control_3 IN MAIN SCRIPT
# - Users MUST overwrite the BC_XX_TARGET and BC_YY_TARGET value with a user-defined time-dependent strain path AFTER this PRESET script is called
# - v_P0 and not ${P0} to be able to define P0 after we call this PRESET script, and redefine it without calling preset again, which is nice
