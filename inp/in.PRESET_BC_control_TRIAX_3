# LAMMPS INPUT FILE DEFINING THE FLAGS FOR BOUNDARY CONDITIONS CONTROL FOR 3D GRANULAR SYSTEMS: AXISYMMETRIC TRIAXIAL STRESS CONDITIONS

# THIS IS A PRESET SCRIPT, ALL VARIABLES AND COMPUTES IN THIS SUBSCRIPT ARE GLOBAL AND ARE LOCALLY REDEFINED ACCORDING TO PRESET VALUES
# THIS SCRIPT CAN BE CALLED MULTIPLE TIMES
# PRESET SCRIPT MUST BE CALLED BEFORE THE CORRESPONDING START SCRIPT
#
#
# INFO:
# - Users MUST overwrite the BC_ZZ_TARGET value with a user-defined time-dependent strain path AFTER this PRESET script is called
# - v_P0 and not ${P0} to be able to define P0 after we call this PRESET script, and redefine it without calling preset again, which is nice
#
# TODO:
# - We could use a strain rate that is passed as argument to avoid hardcoded redefinition in files?
