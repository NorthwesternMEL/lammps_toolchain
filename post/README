* Python post-processing files for LAMMPS simulations:

- post3d.py : module of functions, using Pizza for log and dump files parsing, that analyze the geometry and topology of samples. Also obtain mechanical information from tests, e.g., triaxial, oedometric, heating-cooling
- main_script_post_3d.py: base script (to be specified case-by-case) to perform a chosen post-processing and output of LAMMPS simulations data. Reads data, perform actions from post3d.py, writes results in a clean/structured way
